// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const Analysis = "Perform research and determine the need of the end users as well as comparable alternatives. This stage will also define the system requirements of the prototype."

const Design = "Developers will outline the details such as user interface, system interface, databases, and any other requirements. This is where the code gets written to follow the planning and analysis setps."

const Testing = "This is where the program must be tested vigerously to ensure that there aren't any bugs and that the end user won't experience any issues on their end after the program is launched."

const Implementation = "This is where the program is placed in it's enviroment that it will be live in. It gets intigrated and installed and checked to make sure that none of the new aspects have stopped the program from working correctly."

const Maintain = "This is where we tell the customer, good luck. Have fun. Don't die. .... okay no, not really. This is where we continue to receive feedback on issues or changes that need to be considered and implimenting them after the fact so that the program can run as best as possible."
